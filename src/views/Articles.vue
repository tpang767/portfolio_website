                <p>After graduating from NYU in 2014, I initially worked in business intelligence, using excel and VBA code to drive data analytics and process automation.
                  It was during that time that I began teaching myself programming and
                became the primary liason for engineering and operations department.
                After countless hours of self-study and working on small development projects, I eventually fully commited to a career change after receiving my first
            job offer as a web developer.
